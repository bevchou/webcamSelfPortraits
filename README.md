## Description

Historically, artists have used self-portraits as a way to express different facets of their identities. Now selfies and filters are often used to create illusions or sell things to us. I invite you to create a selfie portrait with your webcam by answering simple questions about yourself. Instead of beautifying or morphing your face, you will add to your image through self reflection. 

Made by Beverly Chou using p5.js, clmtrackr, and the flickr api in Fall 2017.
